# Turtle Tree Drawing

This project uses Python's `turtle` module to draw a fractal tree.

## 📁 File

- `exact_tree_turtle.py`: Python script that draws a tree using turtle graphics.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python** installed. You can check by running:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

2. Download the file `exact_tree_turtle.py`.

3. Run the script using:
    ```bash
    python exact_tree_turtle.py
    ```

A new window will open and draw a tree using turtle graphics.

## 📷 Preview

This program draws a beautiful recursive tree using turtle graphics. Make sure the turtle window doesn't get blocked by other windows.

## 🐍 Requirements

No extra packages are required — only built-in `turtle` module is used.
